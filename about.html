        <p>To qualify for the official limited edition Hacktoberfest shirt,
            you must register and then make four pull requests (PRs) between
            October 1-31 (in any time zone). PRs can be made to any public
            repo on GitHub, not only the ones with issues labeled Hacktoberfest.
            If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam or behavior not in
            line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to
            participate. This year, the first 50,000 participants who successfully
            complete the challenge will earn a T-shirt. (Last year 46,088

        <p><span class="highlight">●</span> PRs that are automated (e.g. scripted opening PRs to remove

        <p><span class="highlight">●</span> PRs that are disruptive (e.g. taking someone else's branch/commits and

            <span class="highlight">●</span> <b>Spammy PRs can be labeled as “invalid.” </b>
            Maintainers are faced with the majority of spam that occurs during Hacktoberfest, and we dislike spam just
            as
            much as you. If you’re a maintainer, please label any spammy PRs submitted to the repositories you maintain
            as
            <b>invalid</b>, and close them. PRs with this label won't count toward Hacktoberfest.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="highlight">●</span> <b>There’s a seven-day review window for PRs. </b>
            This year, we've implemented a new seven-day grace period that all PRs for Hacktoberfest must go through
            before
            they count toward completing the challenge. Once a participant has submitted four eligible PRs
            (ready-to-review,
            not drafts), the review window begins. This period gives maintainers time to identify and label spammy PRs
            as
            <b>invalid</b>. If the PRs are not marked <b>invalid</b> within that window, they will allow the user to
            complete the Hacktoberfest challenge. If any of the PRs are labeled as <b>invalid</b>, however, the user
            will
            return to the pending state until they have four eligible PRs, at which point the review period will then
            start
            again.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="highlight">●</span> <b>Bad repositories will be excluded. </b>
            In the past, we've seen many repositories that encourage participants to make simple PRs – such as adding
            their
            name to a file – to quickly gain a PR toward winning Hacktoberfest. While this may be a learning tool for
            new
            contributors, it goes against one of our core values for Hacktoberfest. The quality of pull requests is
            paramount; quantity comes second. These repositories do not encourage quality contributions and provide an
            unfair advantage in completing the Hacktoberfest challenge. This year, we've implemented a system to block
            these
            repositories, and any pull requests submitted to such repositories will not be counted. If you’d like to
            report
            a repository, please email us at
            <a href="mailto:hacktoberfest@digitalocean.com">Hacktoberfest@DigitalOcean.com</a>.
