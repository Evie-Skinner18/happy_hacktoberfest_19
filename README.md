## Welcome hackers! This project is a beginner-friendly initiative: a fun little ditty to help you get creative with open source.
## Feel free to make a new feature/page and submit a pull request.

### This is my first Hacktoberfest, how do I get started?  :rocket:

- Have a look for issues labelled as 'good first issue', 'hacktoberfest', 'up-for-grabs', or 'first-timers-only'.
- Read the instructions in contributing.md
- Have fun creating something new!

You can view the progress of the website so far here: https://evie-skinner18.github.io/happy_hacktoberfest_19/

## NOTE ##
Please DO NOT submit random pull requests. First check if an issue already exists for the bugs you found and whether someone else is already working on it. If not, create an issue and assign to yourself.

Happy coding!
