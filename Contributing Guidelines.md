## Basics ##
1. Create an account on GitHub

2. Fork this repository to your own GitHub by clicking on the 'Fork' button (on the right)

3. Now you have your own remote copy of the project! Clone this remote repository to your machine so you'll have a local copy:

`git clone https://github.com/Evie-Skinner18/happy_hacktoberfest_19.git`

4. Open up the code in a code editor (e.g Atom, Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Notepad... ;-> ). Add your meaningful
   contribution!

5. Commit your changes from the root directory of the project (happy_hacktoberfest_19):
   `git add .`
   `git commit -m "[Write a message that briefly explains the change you've made]"`

6. Push your changes from the local repository on your machine to the forked remote repository on your GitHub:
   `git push`

7. Make a pull request to ask for your changes to be integrated (merged) into the original happy_hacktoberfest_19 that you forked
   from Evie-Skinner18 back in step 2. On your GitHub, click the 'Pull Request' button and ensure that the base fork is 'base
   fork: Evie-Skinner18/happy_hacktoberfest_19' and the head fork is '[your GitHub name]/happy_hacktoberfest_19'.

8. I will review your contribution and merge it into the original master branch!

If these instructions are unclear, here is an excellent video from the lads at Lingonsaft who organised a cracking Hacktoberfest
website last year: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIj2q02gvKs&t=133s

_Remember hackers, Hacktoberfest is about quality over quantity. However, this repository is aimed mostly at those who are
beginners to open source and to coding in general, so if this is your first ever open source contribution, don't hesitate to correct
a spelling mistake or change something very small. Enjoy!_
