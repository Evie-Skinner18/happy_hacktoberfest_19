        <p>Halloween is a celebrated in several countries. It is one of the world's 
        oldest holidays. In some countries it is celebrated with trick-or-treating, 
        costume parties, pumpkin carving, and mischievous acts.</p>

        <p>The act of decorating jackolanterns comes from an Irish folktale about a 
        man named Stingy Jack. He is is also known as Jack the Smith, Drunk Jack, 
        Flaky Jack, and Jack of the Lantern.</p>

        <p>The story has many variations as far as specifics go. Quite a long time 
        ago in the towns an villages of Ireland Stingy Jack was known as a drunk. 
        He was a bad person who would steal, manipulate, and was generally no good.</p>

        <p>One day Satan comes to collect his soul. He invites him for a drink and 
        Satan agrees. After the drink at the pub, Jack convinces Satan to pay for their 
        drinks. Satan turns himself into a coin so that Jack can use the coin to pay 
        for the drinks. Instead Jack puts the coin in his pocket which also contains a 
        crucifix. The crucifix kept Satan from escaping his form. Jack convinced Satan 
        to agree to leave him along for a number of years if he set him free. Satan 
        agreed.</p>

        <p>After the years had passed Jack once again faces Satan. This time Jack 
        convinces Satan to climb a tree to pick a piece of fruit for him to eat. As 
        Satan is up in the tree Jack prevents him from climbing down with a crucifix. 
        They once again come to agreement. If Jack lets him free, Satan must never 
        bother him again and never take his soul.</p>
