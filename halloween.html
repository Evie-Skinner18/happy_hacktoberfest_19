            <p>Halloween is celebrated in several countries. It is one of the world's 
            oldest holidays. In some countries it is celebrated with trick-or-treating, 
            costume parties, pumpkin carving, and mischievous acts.</p>

            <p>The act of decorating jackolanterns comes from an Irish folktale about a 
            man named Stingy Jack. He is is also known as Jack the Smith, Drunk Jack, 
            Flaky Jack, and Jack of the Lantern.</p>

            <p>The story has many variations as far as specifics go. Quite a long time 
            ago in the towns an villages of Ireland Stingy Jack was known as a drunk. 
            He was a bad person who would steal, manipulate, and was generally no good.</p>

            <p>One day Satan comes to collect his soul. He invites him for a drink and 
            Satan agrees. After the drink at the pub, Jack convinces Satan to pay for their 
            drinks. Satan turns himself into a coin so that Jack can use the coin to pay 
            for the drinks. Instead Jack puts the coin in his pocket which also contains a 
            crucifix. The crucifix kept Satan from escaping his form. Jack convinced Satan 
            to agree to leave him along for a number of years if he set him free. Satan 
            agreed.</p>

            <p>After the years had passed Jack once again faces Satan. This time Jack 
            convinces Satan to climb a tree to pick a piece of fruit for him to eat. As 
            Satan is up in the tree Jack prevents him from climbing down with a crucifix. 
            They once again come to agreement. If Jack lets him free, Satan must never 
            bother him again and never take his soul.</p>

            <p>Some time later Jack died. Rejected at the Gates of Heaven due to his 
            sinful ways. Satan, angry about the tricks, and keeping his word, wouldn't 
            let Jack into Hell. Satan gave Jack a glowing ember for a light and sent him 
            on his way. He has been roaming the earth ever since.</p>

            <p>In Ireland and Scotland people started making their own versions of Jack's 
            lanterns by carving potatos and turnips to frighten away Stingy Jack and other 
            spirits. In America the pumpkin is the fruit of choice.</p>
